# Project | Module 1


## Introduction

The goal of this projectis to apply all data analytics concepts that I have learned so far to real-world data both to practice and better understand how these concepts are useful. 


## Project Scenario
You are a team of three consultants that have compiled and analysed data to help answer the question that you formulated/was given to you by the Amsterdam City Council. Today you are presenting your results to a subcommittee from the council. The subcommittee is quite busy so they only have 15 minutes for each presentation, followed by 5-10 minutes of questions. They also want to hear from each of the team members, so make sure that all three of you get to speak up!
